# Blinker Basic
Blinker Basic is an easy way to hook up LED lights to Ableton Live to monitor the metronome pulses. It uses Max for Live and the Arduino plugin from its Connection Kit. 

Make sure *Standard Firmata* is loaded onto your Arduino board first. 

Just load the plugin next to the Arduino (on an Audio Track), then map the big button to a Digital pin output. 

Hit play in Ableton and you should see it start to pulse. 

Future versions include midi control for making your own patterns, full RGB light control, and more.
